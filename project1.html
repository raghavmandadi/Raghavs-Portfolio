                <p class="squeeze textBlock">In light of the recent COVID-19 landscape, business and technology have been forced to adapt rapidly to remote means in order to remain functional. The general K-12 education system has faced immense pressure and challenge to quickly adapt the centuries old in-person model to virtual or distance models of schooling. Our team worked with Avanade to <span>improve upon a sector within the education system that relies on e-learning, specifically first grade.</span> </p>
                <p class="squeeze textBlock">In coming up with a solution, I was to consider and understand the current methods, tools, pain points, and gaps from students, teachers, staff, parents, and anyone else who plays an important role in the transition to e-learning.</p>
                <p class="squeeze textBlock"><span class="boldBlockText">Our project goals were the following:</span></p>

                <h2 class="sectionHeading">Final Concept</h2>
                <p class="squeeze textBlock">Towards the end of our project, our group created a set of <span>mockups highlighting our solution as a Zoom plugin.</span> This plugin was designed by our team with features that would support first grade teachers' specific needs. <br> We broke it down into the following four categories:</p>
                <div class="mockupTabs squeeze">
                    <div class="tabNav">
                        <button class="tabButton" data-for-tab="1">Visible Features</button>
                        <button class="tabButton" data-for-tab="2">Breakout Rooms</button>
                        <button class="tabButton" data-for-tab="3">Feedback</button>
                        <button class="tabButton" data-for-tab="4">Engagement</button>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tabContent" data-tab="1">
                        <p>Highlighting important features

                            For our concept of making important features more visible, we added the raise hand, yes, and no buttons to the main toolbar for students. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tabContent" data-tab="2">
                        <p>New breakout room format

                            For our concept of creating a new breakout room format, we made it so the teacher can see all the breakout rooms on one screen along with a video feed. 
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="tabContent" data-tab="3">
                        <p>Receive feedback from students

                            For helping teachers receive feedback from students, we created a simple way for 1st graders to say how they are feeling about class content. 
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="tabContent" data-tab="4">
                        <p>Keep students engaged

                            Students being distracted is something that teachers have difficulty dealing with in e-learning. To alleviate this, we designed a way for teachers to keep students engaged over Zoom by sending them an attention grabber.

                    <p class="textBlock">As the entire K-12 learning sphere would be too large and unfocused of a scope, our team had to ultimately decide upon a problem scope that would allow us to target specific problems and pain points. Through some literary research and preliminary interviews, we decided to give our full attention to the <span>first grade learning space, specifically designing for first grade teachers.</span>  These methods gave us the required insight to narrow down.</p>

                <h2 class="sectionHeading">Interviews</h2>
                <p class="squeeze textBlock"><span>During this project, I made a drastic change in my mental approach to ethnographic practices. I personally used to heavily stray away from these methods, such as observations or interviews because I would get nervous, feel unprepared, and would lack skills to create an open dialouge in a comfortable manner. These were personal predicaments that needed to change to further myself in improving my UX research skills. I assumed the role of facilitating, managing, and conducting stakeholder interviews to tackle this.</span>  </p>
                <p class="squeeze textBlock">After 11 interviews with teachers, parents, and administrators, my biggest personal takeaway was in fact my increasing fondness and appreciation of this process. An understanding that people love to talk about what they love motivated me to push through each interview, slowly focusing on the conversation and the in-the-moment learning as opposed to constantly being in stress about the information that we need and the goals we have to meet.  </p>
                <p class="squeeze textBlock">The interview rounds proved to be extremely vital as our project was built around the first hand information and insights stakeholders could provide us. </p>

For much of the preliminary ideation rounds, we stuck to simple paper and whiteboarding sketches to design simple systems that could be integrated in and improve a first-grade teachers workflow. The sketch themes included tools that helped teachers assess their students,  improving upon existing online resources, and methods to facilitate social interactions. </p>

                        <li>Improving upon and filling gaps in an existing service held the most merit as it poses the least resistance to be embedded in a teachers workflow </li>

                <h2 class="sectionHeading">Concept Building + Evaluation</h2>
                <p class="squeeze textBlock">We chose zoom as a platform to design a plugin upon since it was used by the majority of teachers we talked to, as well as supported the use of plugins. After synthesizing the interviews and ideation rounds, we came up with a set of categories that we could build our final concept off of, and met with additional first grade teachers to evaluate our ideas. Each of the categories designs upon the four most prominent pain points in a first grade teachers experience, and were finalized after the feedback from the teachers. </p>
