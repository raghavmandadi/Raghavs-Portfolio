            <p>Engage the football equipment manger community on a mobile application to ultimately provide pictures and data for a developing artificial intelligence identification software. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Why</h4>
            <p>Due to the niche nature of the football equipment manager profession, resources are not readily avaible for the necessary skills to be learned, creating a need for exploration and development. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>How </h4>
            <p>A mobile application designed to engage both novice and experienced equipment managers in a learning environment, centered around user-generated content to ultimately provide data for the developing artifical intelligence software.  </p>

            <h4>Who is Helmet Tracker?</h4>

        <div>
            <h4>What are Equipment Managers?</h4>
            <p>Equipment managers (EMs) are highly speciailzed individuals who track and manage equipment for athletic teams. In our project context, we are targeting the equipment managers who work with football equipment and other associated parts. </p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <div>
            <p>The development team at Helmet Tracker currently works on an artificial intelligence software to idenfity helmets and equipment through a picture or a video. </p>
            <img src="images/HTlogo.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>For this to work, the executive team at Helmet Tracker tasked our team with <b>developing an application that collects media of identified helmets in any way possible from the EM community</b> to aid in the machine learning process. The sponsor had mentioned to try and utilize gamification techniques, which is how we arrived at our next stage.</p>
