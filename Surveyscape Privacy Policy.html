                <p>Surveyscape is a utility application created to provide support to research studies. Below is our Privacy Policy explaining how data is collected and used. The below clauses are separated into two sections, one for a specified user, and one for a non-specified user. <br> <br>

                    A specified user is the primary user for Surveyscape. Due to the nature of this application, we only collect the data from users who have previously agreed to the terms of a survey through an external survey organizer on our end. These specified users are given a five digit number to use to log into Surveyscape. The user then has access to an external Qualtrics survey that is created by our survey organizers. <br> <br>
                    
                    A non-specified user is for those who do not wish to participate in an organized survey, but would still like to test out some functions of the app. We do not store any information from these users. <br> <br>

                    If at any point you believe that Surveyscape has collected data without your consent or has broken any of these privacy clauses, please promptly contact your survey organizer. <br> <br>

            </div>
            <div class="subClause">
                <p> 1.1	For Specified Users: Surveyscape only collects location and time data to perform necessary functions. Surveyscape will continuously monitor precise location locally but will only externally store data relevant to the purpose of the chosen study. Specifically, Surveyscape will use a hardcoded coordinate location to only track when a user enters or exits a specific radius around these coordinate points. The date and time of entry and exit of the given location will be collected, as well as the duration of time spent within the region. The collection of this data will be continuous and automatic for the duration of the study, or a duration that a user has previously agreed to with our external survey organizer. The collection of this data is private and is only attached to the five-digit number provided prior to the download of Surveyscape. There is no identification data required for the use of Surveyscape. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="subClause">
                <p>1.2	For Non-Specified Users: Surveyscape only collects location data to perform necessary functions. Surveyscape will continuously monitor precise location locally and will not store any information externally. Surveyscape will set a radius around a user-selected coordinate point, and track when a user enters or exits a specific radius around these coordinate points. The collection of this data will be continuous and automatic until the user ‘logs out’ of the non-specified user side of the application. </p>

            <div class="subClause">
                <p>2.1	For Specified Users: Users must voluntarily grant Surveyscape permissions to collect all data. Surveyscape will prompt a user upon opening the app to collect location data. Due to the nature of the app, Surveyscape will likely require the user to ‘always’ provide location data. Location data will be collected automatically and locally through the application. A user’s precise location or any precise location data will NEVER be stored anywhere at any time and is only used to record time data relevant to an entry or exit of a specified region corresponding to the organized survey. Time data will be collected from the user’s local phone time. Surveyscape does NOT store location data, only time data corresponding to the location of a user. The collection of this data is private and is only attached to the five-digit number provided prior to the download of Surveyscape. There is no identification data required or collected by Surveyscape. </p>

The user has the option to accept or reject the terms with the survey organizer and will only become a specified user if the user voluntarily accepts.
